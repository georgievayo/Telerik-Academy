# Whiskey-Soar
Description of the project:

The project is a classic break bricks game. The idea is the user to "break" all the bricks with the ball which should be prevented from dropping out of the screen. The game has 3 difficulty levels where in the easiest one the ball moves the slowest and each next level speeds up the ball speed.
<br>
The source code of the game is plain JavaScript and no external libraries are used.
Major features of the game:
<br>
-	3 difficulty levels
-	2 kinds of bricks
-	“Responsive” design
-	Magic point bonus – if you hit in between two bricks it breaks both of them
-	Sound effects
