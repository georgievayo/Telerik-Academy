ERROR: Error activating ICommand
No matching bindings are available, and the type is not self-bindable.
Activation path:
  1) Request for ICommand

Suggestions:
  1) Ensure that you have defined a binding for ICommand.
  2) If the binding was defined in a module, ensure that the module has been loaded into the kernel.
  3) Ensure you have not accidentally created more than one kernel.
  4) If you are using constructor arguments, ensure that the parameter name matches the constructors parameter name.
  5) If you are using automatic module loading, ensure the search path and filters are correct.
